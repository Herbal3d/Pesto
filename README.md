# Pesto
Controller for Basil viewer.

Pesto is started first and manages the multiple, interconnected programs
that create the view displayed by the [Basil viewer].

The eventual dream is to have Pesto be one's presence -- a program
that is always running and keeping one's presence in the virtual world
or whatever medium one is connected to. The [Basil viewer] creates a
view into a world but one can be there without looking at the world.
